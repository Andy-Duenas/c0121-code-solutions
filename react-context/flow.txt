*User can sign up.
  React renders the App Component.
  The App Component gets initalized and renders;
  renderPage() method gets called and checks for a path on its states route.
  If it is sign-up the <Auth /> gets created.

  Inside AuthPage class it gets rendered.
  If the user is already logged in, they will be redirected.
  If the user is not logged in then it will continue and create a <AuthForm>.

  Inside AuthForm, it gets initalized and renders.
  Sign in or Sign up depend on the alternateActionHref.
  Once user clicks on sign up with a username and password
  handleSubmit will be called and send a fetch request to the server with a sign-up action.

  When the server recieves the request, it checks for valid input and throws
  an error if input was invalid.
  If the input is valid, it hashes the password and inserts the hashed password
  into the database using an sql insert statement.

  If the insertion was succesfull the user will get a responce and the page
  will redirect to the  Sign in page.

*User can sign in.

  When the User enters their username, password, and clicks submit,
  a fetch request with Sign-in action will be sent to the server.

  When the server recieves the request, it checks for valid input and throws
  an error if input was invalid.
  An sql select statement gets made and used to query the database.
  When we recieve a responce, the server checks if they found the user, if not
  an error gets sent.
  Then the passsword and hashedPassword gets verifed to see if they are the same.
  if not an error gets sent.
  If everything went smooth, a payload and toke are generated and sent back to the client.
  When the client gets a response it checks if the user and token are valid.
  onSignIn gets called a and saves the results into the localStorage and sets the property to user.

*User can stay signed in (even if they refresh the page).

  React renders the App Component.
  The App Component gets initalized and renders;
  componentDidMount adds an event listener to the window which changes the route state,
  checks for the localStorage token and sets the property to user.

*User can sign out.

  Sign out removes the token from the local storage.
  Then a hashchange event is triggered and user property of the state is changed to null.
  Finally the app rerenders back to the sign in/ sign up page.
